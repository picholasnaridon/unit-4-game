### About

This project was built using React. It allows a user to select a character and "battle" the remaining characters in an "incredibly immersive" simulation of the Star Wars universe. 

The biggest challenge here was the logic behind the win and loss conditions. It ended up being large switch statement, which I'd love to refactor at some point in the future, but it seems to do the job.
